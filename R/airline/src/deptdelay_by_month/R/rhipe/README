Example RHIPE script to calculate average departure delays per month for each
airline. This example uses the airline arrival and departure data available
here:
  
  http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

This example assumes the data has been uploaded to "/data/airline/" in HDFS.
If you've loaded this data into a different directory in HDFS then change the
"ifolder" value in the rhmr() function.

This example also assumes you've installed Hadoop, R, and RHIPE. This code has been tested with CDH3 (Hadoop 0.20.2), R 2.12.2, and RHIPE 0.65.4 on Ubuntu 10.10.

Running the code:

* Set an environment variable pointing to the Hadoop install directory
    $ export HADOOP=HADOOP_HOME
* Execute the script:
    $ ./rhipe.R

When the script completes you should see an Rplots.pdf file containing the plot
generated from the output data.
