Example script using Hadoop Interactive (hive) to execute a MapReduce job to
calculate average departure delays per month for each airline. This example
uses the airline arrival and departure data available here:
  
  http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

This example assumes the data has been uploaded to "/data/airline/" in HDFS.
If you've loaded this data into a different directory in HDFS then change the
"input" value in the hive_stream() function.

This example also assumes you've installed Hadoop, R and Hadoop Interactive. This code has been tested with CDH3 (Hadoop 0.20.2), R 2.12.2 and Hadoop Interactive 0.1-10 on Ubuntu 10.10.

Running the code:

* Set an environment variable pointing to the Hadoop install directory
    $ export HADOOP_HOME=HADOOP_HOME
* Execute the script:
    $ ./hive.R
